### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), and I am studying Human-Computer Interaction.

You can find me at `zhuangbi` at@at@cat@i-mean-at@ `connect.ust.hk`.

> Fun facts: `zhuangbi` is a randomly and uniquely  generated username by my university.
> But in Chinese, it happens to mean "to flex" (U.S. Slang) or "to show off (one's capabilities) (sometimes in a flaunty way)".
> That makes this name super cool and I love it!

## And I love...

A lot of things! I love music (Rock, Pop rock, Jazz, R&B, Blues, Fusion...) and I play the drumset. I love cooking dishes and drinking/brewing coffee (I used to bake as well). I love going to art exhibitions (modern arts especially) or just random sightseeing and street-walking.
